# 👋 Hi, I'm Mahdi Solgi!

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a **front-end web developer**  on a mission to craft elegant, functional, and responsive web experiences. With a passion for **clean code** and an obsession with **design details**, I aim to bridge the gap between aesthetics and performance.  

- 🌍 Currently exploring **React** & **TypeScript**  
- 📊 Practicing **State Management** & API testing with **React Query** and **Postman**  
- 🌱 Learning every day to grow as a developer and as a person

## 🔥 My Skills
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript (ES6+)** – Foundation of everything I create  
- **React** – Components, hooks, and state magic  
- **TypeScript** – Adding reliability to code (still leveling up!)  
- **Git & GitHub** – Collaborating and keeping things under control  
- **Next** – creaing full-stack web applications
- **Figma** – Translating designs from pixels to code

## ✨ Fun Fact
I used to think the **branch name** at the bottom left of VS Code that is usually *master* was for when you become a *master in coding*! 🤣 (Guess not!)
